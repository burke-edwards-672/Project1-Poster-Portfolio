            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone, my name is Burke! If it wasn't apparent, my friends and I are very invested in bowling.
                We bowled casually until the summer of 2023, when four of us banded together to create a league whose name 
                strikes fear into the competition... Placing 18th out of 20, the Bucket Ballers showed no mercy to those who opposed!</p>

            <p>Over time, we've accumulated a respectable arsenal of bowling balls. After a couple of introductory shots, we named them each based off of looks and performance.
                One thing led to another, the Scoops poster was created, and now there are a bunch!</p>
